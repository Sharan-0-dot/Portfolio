# Hi, I’m Sharan

I’m a **Computer Science Engineering student** with a strong focus on **backend development**, passionate about building **scalable, real-world systems** rather than just demos.

I primarily work with **Java & Spring Boot** for backend development and **React** for frontend, and I enjoy designing clean APIs, microservice architectures, and cloud-ready applications. Alongside development, I actively practice **Data Structures & Algorithms** to strengthen my problem-solving and system-design thinking.

### What I focus on
- Building **production-grade backend systems** (Spring Boot, Microservices, REST APIs)
- Developing **full-stack applications** (React + Spring Boot)
- Working with **databases, authentication, and distributed systems**
- Applying **DSA concepts** to write efficient and reliable code
- Deploying and running applications on **cloud & containerized environments**

### What you’ll find here
This portfolio showcases my **projects, experiments, and contributions**, reflecting my learning journey and practical experience in software engineering.

I’m continuously learning, improving, and working toward building software that actually scales.

📫 Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me.
